## We need to disable IPv6 because Tor does not support IPv6 yet and may create leaks.
## You can verify the setting applied by: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6, which should return 1.
## Advanced users only: If you were unwilling or unable to disable IPv6 you would have to create an IPv6 firewall.
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
